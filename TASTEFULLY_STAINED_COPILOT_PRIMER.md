I'm implementing **Tastefully Stained**: an AI Content Provenance & Watermarking Service - a C2PA-compliant content watermarking solution with hybrid DCT/DWT algorithms and blockchain anchoring for autonomous revenue generation.

I have a comprehensive Master Action Plan that breaks development into 10 phases. I need your help implementing this systematically using maximum code quality standards and autonomous development practices.

**Key Requirements:**
- All code must have comprehensive type hints (Python/TypeScript)
- >95% test coverage target
- Production-ready error handling and logging
- Comprehensive docstrings with examples
- Security-first approach throughout
- Performance optimization from the start
- Complete unit tests for every module before moving on

**Development Standards I'm Enforcing:**
1. No implementation without corresponding tests
2. All external API calls must have error handling and retry logic
3. Structured logging throughout (DEBUG, INFO, WARN, ERROR)
4. All public methods must have docstrings with examples
5. Performance benchmarks for time-sensitive operations
6. Input validation and sanitization on all endpoints

**The Workflow:**
1. I'll ask you to implement a specific phase or component
2. You generate the complete implementation following the specs
3. I review the generated code
4. You generate comprehensive tests
5. We verify tests pass and coverage is >95%
6. Move to next phase only after approval

**Starting Now:**

Let's begin Phase 1: Environment & Infrastructure Setup

### Task 1.1: Create Project Directory Structure

Create the complete directory structure for Tastefully Stained as specified in the Master Action Plan. This includes:
- backend/ with all subdirectories
- frontend/ with all subdirectories  
- contracts/ for smart contracts
- .github/workflows/ for CI/CD
- docs/ for documentation
- tests/ with proper structure

Generate all necessary __init__.py files and configuration files (.gitignore, etc).

After you complete the directory structure, I'll review it before we move to the next task.

---

**Once directory structure is approved, we'll continue with:**
- Task 1.2: Python requirements.txt with all dependencies
- Task 1.3: Docker configuration (backend, frontend, docker-compose)
- Task 1.4: GitHub Actions CI/CD pipelines

I'll provide detailed specifications for each task. Please wait for approval before moving between tasks.

Let's build Tastefully Stained systematically and ensure production-quality code from the start!
